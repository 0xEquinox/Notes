* Properties of Derivatives
** Sum/Difference Property
The integral of two functions added or subtracted from each other is the same as the sum or difference of the integral of each function:
\[ \int_{a}^{b}(f(x) \pm g(x))\,dx = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx \pm \int_{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx\]
** Constant Multiple Property
The integral of a function times constant k, is the same as constant k times the integral of a function:
\[\int_{a}^{b}k*f(x)\,dx = k * \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\, dx\]
** Reverse Interval
An integral from range a to b will be the same, but opposite of an integral that goes from b to a:
\[\int_a^b f(x)dx=-\int_b^a f(x)dx \]
** Zero Length Interval
An integral with a range of zero will be zero:
\[\int_a^a f(x)dx = 0 \]
** Adding Interval
The sum of two integrals with the range a to b and b to c is equal to the integral from range a to c:
 \[\int_a^b f(x)dx+\int_b^c f(x)dx=\int_a^c f(x)dx \]

* Solving Integrals
There are two kinds of approaches to solving integrals. Approximations and actually correct answers.
