Riemann sums can be used to approximate the area under a curve, or the interval in fancy math language. It works by summing the areas of rectangles to fill the approximate area under a curve.
** Left Riemann Sum
Gives an underestimate of the integral when f(x) is increasing, and an overestimate when f(x) is decreasing.
** Right Riemann Sums
Gives an overestimate of the integral when f(x) is increasing and an underestimate when f(x) is decreasing.
** Middle Riemann Sums
Gives a middle approximation, which is ideal, but it's way more work that is really not important for an approximation.
